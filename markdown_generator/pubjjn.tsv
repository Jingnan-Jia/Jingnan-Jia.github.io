2019-12-01	Wideband circularly polarized dielectric resonator antenna loaded with partially reflective surface	Journal	A wideband circularly polarized (CP) dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) loaded with the partially reflective surface for gain enhancement is presented in this article. First, the DRA is excited by a microstrip line through modified stepped ring cross‐slot to generate the circular polarization. Four modified parasitic metallic plates are sequentially placed around the DRA for greatly widening the axial‐ratio bandwidth. Then, a partially reflective surface is introduced for enhancing the gain performance and further improving the CP bandwidth as well. Finally, an optimized prototype is fabricated to verify the design concept. The measured results show that the proposed DRA achieves 54.3% impedance bandwidth (VSWR<2) and 54.9% 3‐dB AR bandwidth. Besides, its average and peak gains are 10.7 dBic and 14.2 dBic, respectively. Wide CP band and high gains make the proposed DRA especially attractive for some broadband wireless applications such as satellite communication and remote sensing.	Wen, J., Jiao, Y. C., Zhang, Y.
